				<p>
				I am Clara Lepoutre, spanish student in Master of Digital Marketing at a business school in Lille. My passion in life is travelling, discovering new places, their landscapes, their gastronomy, but above all, for me, the most important thing about travelling is connecting with local cultures by really getting to know their people and their way of life. Travelling makes me happy. 🌍

				<h2>Colombia 🇨🇴 </h2>
				<p>
				In January 2019 I went to Colombia for a six-month exchange at a business school in Bogota. Besides studying I had the opportunity to travel and discover the wonderful country of Colombia. On one of my trips I connected with the place and its inhabitants, this came up in the desert of La Guajira, in the north of Colombia. I worked for the travel agency there sponsoring it through my social networks. And here is my second passion: social networking!

				<h2>Social Networking 👩🏽‍💻</h2>
				<p>
				I like social networks very much and I am also aware of the limits of using them. I like to share content about my travels and recommend sites that I have liked, be it restaurants, parks or agencies that have helped me organize a trip. Also, I've loved photography since I was a little girl so I like to share beautiful and original photos. I'm learning to make videos as I also like this.

				<h2>Astrology 💫⭐</h2>
				<p>
				Another of my great passions is the astrology. For as long as I can remember I have loved to look at the sky and imagine what is happening up there so far away from us. Since I am 18 years old I have had an astrologer who helps me in the important decisions of my life, he is a friend who studies space engineering.
